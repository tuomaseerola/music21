# music21
This folder contains [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) teaching demos for sessions in Music and Science at Durham University. The best learning resource for [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) are the music21 documentation pages. Start with [What is music21?](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/about/what.html) if you don't know what this `python` based tool is all about. 

This first session, titled [ScoreAnalysisTutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/ScoreAnalysisTutorial.ipynb) covers the basics of [Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/). It includes a short introduction, few words about the python and code blocks, and introduces the *learning tasks*.

The second session, titled [corpus_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/corpus_demo.ipynb), will demonstrate how the build-in corpora can be used, searched and some simple features (e.g., key) of music can be extracted and tallied up.

Both demonstration are Jupyter notebooks. They are designed to run in [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), which allows any computer to run them in the cloud server without having to worry about the installation of [python](https://www.python.org), [musescore](https://musescore.org/en), or [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) or other essentials.
