# music21

This folder contains [music21]([http://web.mit.edu/music21/](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/about/what.html)) teaching demos for sessions in _Music and Science_ at Durham University. The best learning resource for [music21]([http://web.mit.edu/music21/](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/about/what.html)) are the [music21 documentation pages]([http://web.mit.edu/music21/]([https://www.music21.org/music21docs/](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/)). Start with [What is music21?]([http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/about/what.html](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/about/what.html)) if you don't know what this tool is all about. 

This tutorial, titled [ScoreAnalysisTutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/ScoreAnalysisTutorial.ipynb) covers the basics of [Music21]([http://web.mit.edu/music21/](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/about/what.html)). It includes a short introduction, few words about the python and code blocks, and introduces the *learning tasks*.

The second session, which is optional in 2024, is titled [corpus_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/corpus_demo.ipynb), and it will demonstrate how the build-in corpora can be used, searched and some simple features (e.g., key) of music can be extracted and tallied up.

Both demonstrations are Jupyter notebooks. They are designed to run in [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), which allows any computer to run them in the cloud server without having to worry about the installation of [python](https://www.python.org), [musescore](https://musescore.org/en), or [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) or other essentials.
