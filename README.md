# music21
Music21 demos for teaching in Music and Science (Year 2 UG Module, Durham University).

This first session, titled [music21_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/music21_demo.ipynb) covers the basics of [Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/). It includes a short introduction, few words about the python and code blocks, and introduces the *learning tasks*.

The second session, titled [corpus_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/music21/blob/master/corpus_demo.ipynb), will demonstrate how the build-in corpora can be used, searched and some simple features (e.g., key) of music can be extracted and tallied up.

Both demonstration are Jupyter notebooks. They are designed to run in [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), which allows any computer to run them in the cloud server without having to worry about the installation of [python](https://www.python.org), [musescore](https://musescore.org/en), Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) or other essentials.
